            <span class="highlight-word"> Creative Engineer </span>
            <div class="separator"></div>

            <p>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet, I am a software engineer, gamer, artist, plant lover and much more, based in Gothenburg, Sweden. I have over 10 years of experience in startups, consulting and large enterprises across Scotland, Germany and Sweden.</p>
            <p>When I applied for the computer science program at the University of Gothenburg in spring of 2010 I was torn, because at the same time I also applied for an acting school a bit outside the city. Two completely different paths in life, one creative path and one rational (in a dual sense). As you might understand, I chose the latter.</p>
            <p>Luckily, the route we take professionally has no real imprint on what we really are. That's why I call myself a Creative Engineer, and that's something I try to show with this website which I wrote during my parental leave in 2025 in native JavaScript (consider that a personal opinion about modern web development). </p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <span class="highlight-word">Oted Online</span>
            <p>My online alias started as Detox in the game World of Warcraft around 2005. I later thought it was too cringe and reversed the word it into Xoted, where the X went in the end I cant fully remember but since then it has been Oted and this website is thus <span class="highlight-word"> me online! </span>. It serves as a semi professional portfolio but is also a host for private purposes such as selfhosting, personal server playground and a rather sophisticated media management cloud <span class="highlight-word">Arr!</span> </p>
            <p>The algorithm running in the canvas is similar to <span class="highlight-word">Conway's Game of Life</span> with some personal adjustments. The architecture is event-driven where one tile can trigger its neighbours limited by a declining strength of the color it contains. Check it out on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Oted/otedonline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub!</a></p>
            <p><span class="highlight-word"> Disclaimer: </span> oted.online is made entirely without AI! Did you know that in May 2025 the amount of content created on the internet by AI <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans">surpassed</a> content made by us. When an ever increasing amount of what we consume online is just a generic sum over all created in the past, what does it do to the internet and what we consume? When the data fed to the models is also increasingly made by AI? Where does <span class="highlight-word">poetry</span> live then? </p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <span class="highlight-word">Moar than code</span>
            <p>I have always been a hobby musician and have over the years played several instruments, perhaps the most noteworthy being the <span class="highlight-word"> Musical Saw</span>, which I started playing in my early teens. Until I put up something more recent up, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiIlvfZYBoE" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> A bright horizon</a> made many years ago.</p>
            <p>I love plants! To every spring start anew and with the returning sun see the seeds grow to life is something that brings be great joy. Chillies are a favorite since I have so little space (balcony approx 5m2) and in the autumn I normally bring them inside and turn them into bonshies! </p>
            <p>Zen has been with me (on and off) from early teens and has done more than anything for my well being and shaping who I am. I am forever grateful for Pake Hall at Gothenburg Zen Center, Kalle at Glasgow Cloud Water Zen Centre and Patrick Ehinger at Zen im leben in Berlin. Without you I would have never kept it up, gassho! </p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <span class="highlight-word"> Inspirations </span>
            <p> Below are a few visionaries that have shaped me to the man I am today, they all walked their own path in life and strived towards seeing truthfully on the world and society. </p>

              <img width="150" height="150" class="box-image" src="./assets/buckminster.png" alt="Buckminster Fuller" />
              <p> <span class="highlight-word"> Buckminster Fuller </span> <br/> Mr Fuller dedicated his entire life for the better of humanity and believed that by continuously doing <span class="highlight-word"> more with less</span> with science and technology, we can free society from scarcity and there need not be any suffering. </p>
            </div>

              <p> <span class="highlight-word"> Alan Watts </span> <br/> Although criticized by the Zen community I have nothing but gratitude to Alan for introducing Zen to me. His lectures in the <span class="highlight-word"> Out of your mind </span> series is something I return to over and over and it has brought me back to the cushion and the wall countless times. </p>

                <p> <span class="highlight-word"> Jacque Fresco </span> <br/> Another man who walked his own path in life (yes it's a theme here). He envisioned a society free from the constraints of the monetary system. Instead he argued it's possible to create a resource based economy which would be based on the latest scientific and technological knowledge. Think about it like the principles of a library but for everything we need in life. <span class="highlight-word"> Because will we ever have peace as long as some have nothing while others have everything?</span> Is it really human nature to fight? Or do we fight simply because the resources are not distributed properly? </p>
            </div>
 
            <div class="about-content-container row-left"> 
              <img width="150" height="150" class="box-image" src="./assets/kjell-hoglund.png" alt="Kjell Höglund" />
              <p> <span class="highlight-word"> Kjell Höglund </span> <br/> <i> Men för mig är ju hela showen gåtfull. Många människor tycker inte det är något konstigt. Stjärnor på himmelen, atomer och det växer träd å de…. Men jag liksom ropar mot himmelen och undrar vad in i helvete är det för nånting va? Och där nånstans tror jag skillnaden ligger, att man antingen tar livet för givet eller bara tycker det är fullständigt obegripligt. </i> <br/> Kjell is not just a great musician, but a poet and a philosopher. He delivers his ideas about the world with a perfect mix of humor, thought and catchiness. I keep finding new meaning in his work still today and his music has inspired me to think for myself since childhood. </p>

                    <p> Soon after the move I switched to a new job in a larger company in the dating industry. I got to work with some very talented people and learned <span class="highlight-word"> Golang </span> inside and out. We also dealt with a lot of purchased software which forced me to learn many other technologies. </p>
                    <p> After a few years I needed a break and took some time unemployed before I focused my attention again on the start-up sector and found a job at <a href="https://grid.gg/" class="link">GRID Esports</a>. GRID is a perfect match for me not only because I get to work with my favorite game <span class="highlight-word"> Dota 2</span>, but also because the tech stack is super interesting, I especially enjoy real time data processing challenges using <span class="highlight-word"> Kafka</span>.</p>

                    <p> After my degree I spread my applications wide across Europe with a focus on start-ups. I was very close ending up in London, but a small fashion company contacted me from Edinburgh and I got my first job as a <span class="highlight-word"> Backend Engineer </span> working mostly in NodeJS. I spent the following years in the beautiful city of Edinburgh, working and making connections with many important people in my life.

It's a good program with relevant but hard courses. I still remember the first course we had was functional programming with Haskell and by the end of the semester the class had literally halved in size. This was an ongoing trend and only a handful of students made it through the entire program. That I was one of them is something that makes me proud to this day. </p>

                  <span> GSI was a pet project of mine mostly during the years in Scotland. It was a great entertainment website with a rather early adoption of infinite scroll of recent popular videos, gifs and images. </span>

                  <span> A small project I did to both learn more about both the Mandelbrot set and Rust, but also to visually understand what happens with the set as Z changes. Perhaps one day I should improve the canvas display since it's a bit grainy on deeper zooms. </span>

                  <span> This project was a collaborative YouTube playlist, people could join the same "room" and queue videos over websockets at parties and gatherings. It was never marketed and thus only used by me and my friends. Still a great product and a great learning experience. </span>

                  <span> My first ever project on the web was actually the most successful one with thousands of daily users. It was a simple search engine for subtitles online, you could drag and drop a video and the engine would try to locate the exact match via web crawlers. Unfortunately the payment for the domain failed one year and somebody bought it up before I could. </span>
