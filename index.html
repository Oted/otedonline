            <span class="highlight-word"> Creative Engineer </span>
            <div class="separator"></div>

            <p>I am currently employed as a Staff Engineer located in Gothenburg but working remotely. I have over 10 years of experience in startups, consulting and large enterprises across Scotland, Germany and Sweden.</p>

            <p>When I applied to University of Gothenburg in the spring of 2010 I was torn, because at the same time I also applied for an acting school a bit outside the city. Two completely different paths in life, one creative path and one rational (in a dual sense). As you might understand, I chose the latter.</p>

            <p>Luckily, the route we take professionally has no real imprint on what we really are. That's why I call myself a Creative Engineer, and that's something I try to show with this website which I wrote during my parental leave in 2025 in <span class="highlight-word">native JavaScript</span> (I am so over modern web development).</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>
            <span class="highlight-word">Oted Online</span>
            <p>The algorithm running in the canvas is similar to <span class="highlight-word">Conway's Game of Life</span> with some personal adjustments. The architecture is event-driven where one tile can call its neighbours limited by a declining strength of the color it contains. It's mainly event-driven because I found the approach suitable to enable Tiles to talk to each other and its parent node. Check it out on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Oted/otedonline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub!</a></p>

                    <h3> Liebe Berlin </h3>
                    <p> I have so much love for the city of Berlin and the time I spent there and it is hard to decribe this nostalgic period. Berlin is a thriving place both in and out of tech and the people and the experiences I had here grew me into the man I am today. </p>
                    <p> Soon after the move I switched to a new job in a larger company in the dating industry. I got to work with some very talented people and learned <span class="highlight-word"> GoLang </span> inside and out. We also dealt with a lot of purchased software which forced me to learn many other technilogies. </p>
                    <p> After a few years I needed a break and took some time unemplyed before I focused my attention again on the start-up sector and found a job at <a href="https://grid.gg/" class="link">GRID Esports</a>. GRID is a perfect match for me not only because I get to work with my favorite game <span class="highlight-word"> Dota 2</span>, but also because the tech stack is super interesting, I especially enjoy real time data processing challenges using <span class="highlight-word"> Kafka</span>.</p>

                    <h3> Hello Scotland! </h3>
                    <p> After my degree I spread my applications wide across Europe with a focus on start-ups. I was very close of ending up in London, but a small fashion company contacted me from Edinburg and I got my first job as a <span class="highlight-word"> Backend Engineer </span> working mostly in NodeJS. I spent the following years in the beautiful city of Edinburg, working and making connections with many important people in my life. I also started a Meetup to play boardgames, it is still the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/edinburgh-gamers/" target="_blank" class="link">largest board game meetup in the city! </a> </p>

It however put me at a great edge when I applied for work after, since most new grads has no work experience when applying for their first job. </p>

                    <h3>University</h3>
                    <p> I finally decided to do something more useful and applied late to the Computer Science program at the University of Gothenburg and got in! It's a good program with relevant but hard courses, I still remember the first we had was functional programming with Haskell and by the end of the semester the class had literally halved in size. This was an ongoing trend and only a handfull of students made it through the entire program. That I was one of them is something that makes me proud to this day. </p>

                    <p> The years prior to University I was living peak life according to my 20 year old self. I moved here and there in Europe and played <span class="highlight-word"> Musical Saw </span> in bars and for good money in the street. Youtube might or might not still have glimpses of this life. </p>
